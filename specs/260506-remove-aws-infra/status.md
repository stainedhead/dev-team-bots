---

## Phase 4 Tasks (M1: Local Adapters)

- [x] `internal/infrastructure/local/queue/queue.go` — Router + Queue implementing domain.MessageQueue (coverage: 95.1%)
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/local/bus/bus.go` — Bus implementing domain.Broadcaster (coverage: 96.0%)
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/local/fs/fs.go` — FS implementing domain.MemoryStore (coverage: 93.5%)
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/local/budget/budget.go` — BudgetTracker implementing domain.BudgetTracker (coverage: 91.9%)
- [x] All packages pass `go test -race ./internal/infrastructure/local/...`
- [x] `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` all pass with 0 issues
- [x] No new external dependencies (stdlib only)

---

## Phase 5 Tasks (M2: Anthropic Provider)

- [x] `go get github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go@v1.40.0` added as direct dependency
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/anthropic/provider.go` — Provider implementing domain.ModelProvider
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/anthropic/mocks/messages_client.go` — injectable MessagesClient mock
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/anthropic/provider_test.go` — 14 unit tests (100% statement coverage on provider.go)
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/anthropic/provider_integration_test.go` — integration test with `//go:build integration` tag
- [x] `NewFromEnv` reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exclusively; returns clear error if unset
- [x] Rate-limit mapping: HTTP 429 and 503 → `RateLimitError` with `ErrRateLimit` sentinel
- [x] `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` all pass with 0 issues
- [x] Coverage: 100% on implementation package (90.7% total including mocks)

---

## Phase 6 Tasks (M3: Vector Store + Embedder)

- [x] `internal/infrastructure/local/vector/vector.go` — VectorStore implementing domain.VectorStore (coverage: 92.4%)
  - On-disk format: `<key>.vec` (binary LE: [uint32 dim][float32*dim]) + `<key>.meta` (JSON)
  - Atomic writes via temp-file + os.Rename
  - Path-traversal prevention: rejects keys starting with `.` or containing `..` segments
  - In-memory flat-slice cache with pre-computed magnitudes for O(n) search
  - `BulkCache` helper for performance testing without disk I/O
  - Benchmark: 40ms per search over 100k × 512-dim vectors (Apple M5 Max, no race detector)
- [x] `internal/infrastructure/local/bm25/embedder.go` — BM25-style feature-hash Embedder implementing domain.Embedder (coverage: 100%)
  - Fixed output dimension: 512 (configurable via `NewEmbedder(dims int)`)
  - Tokenise: lowercase + split on non-letter/non-digit (unicode-aware)
  - Feature hashing: FNV-1a hash mod dims → index; weight = 1/sqrt(unique_tokens)
  - L2-normalised output; zero vector for empty/whitespace-only input
  - Stdlib only — no external dependencies
- [x] 20 unit tests in vector package; 12 unit tests in bm25 package; all pass with -race
- [x] 1 benchmark: BenchmarkSearch100k — 40.3ms/op at 100k × 512-dim (87 iterations, -benchtime=3s)
- [x] `TestSearch100kVectors` timing assertion: < 100ms (non-race), < 3s (race detector)
- [x] `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` all pass with 0 issues
- [x] No new external dependencies (stdlib only)

## Phase 8 Tasks (M5: GitHub Backup)

- [x] `domain.MemoryBackup` interface + `domain.BackupStatus` added to `boabot/internal/domain/memory.go`
- [x] `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5 v5.18.0` added as direct dependency to `boabot/go.mod`
- [x] `boabot/internal/infrastructure/github/backup/backup.go` — GitHubBackup implementing domain.MemoryBackup (coverage: 90.1%)
  - `New(cfg Config) (*GitHubBackup, error)` — validates config, wires opener
  - `Backup(ctx)` — AddGlob + status check + commit + push with pull-and-retry on diverge
  - `Restore(ctx)` — PlainClone on fresh path; PullContext on existing repo
  - `Status(ctx)` — last commit timestamp + pending file count + remote URL
  - injectable `gitRepo` interface for unit-testability (push/pull both on repo, not worktree)
  - `//go:build integration` test in `backup_integration_test.go` (skipped unless `BOABOT_BACKUP_TOKEN` + `BOABOT_BACKUP_REPO_URL` set)
- [x] `boabot/internal/application/backup/scheduled_backup.go` — ScheduledBackupUseCase (coverage: 100%)
  - injectable `cronRunner` interface enables synchronous unit tests without wall-clock waits
  - default schedule `*/30 * * * *`; backup errors are logged non-fatally
- [x] `boabotctl/internal/domain/types.go` — `MemoryStatusResponse` added
- [x] `boabotctl/internal/client/client.go` — `MemoryBackup`, `MemoryRestore`, `MemoryStatus` added to `OrchestratorClient`
- [x] `boabotctl/internal/client/http_client.go` — HTTP implementations for all three memory methods
- [x] `boabotctl/internal/commands/memory.go` — `NewMemoryCmd` with backup/restore/status subcommands (coverage: 100%)
- [x] `boabotctl/cmd/boabotctl/main.go` — `NewMemoryCmd` wired into root command
- [x] All packages pass `go test -race`, `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` with 0 issues
